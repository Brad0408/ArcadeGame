CURRENTLY A WIP

For code go to (SFMLProject -> src) or(https://github.com/Brad0408/ArcadeGame/tree/main/SFMLProject/src)

Recreating the arcade game "Robotron 2084" (https://youtu.be/l800GL6NQPY?t=205) through the SFML library

This project is aiming to recreating the game but through a modern day ECS design

Also using C++ 20 and its 'concepts' to create the components that go into my ECS structure
