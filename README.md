Recreating the arcade game "Robotron 2084" (https://youtu.be/l800GL6NQPY?t=205) through the SFML framework

This project is aiming to recreating the game but through a modern day ECS structure

Also using C++ 20 and its 'concepts' to create the components that go into my ECS structure and learnig different pointer types to deal with memory managment
